#### Functional requirements
- By clicking on the **Settings button**, the **Filtering criteria block** should be toggled
    - It should be possible to sort search results by date or count of views
    - Sorting should work both in the direction of decreasing values and in the direction of increasing values
    - Using a pipe, filter search results by value that a user types in the input
